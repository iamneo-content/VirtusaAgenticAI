"""Machine Learning models directory."""

# This directory contains pre-trained ML models:
# - risk_profile_model.pkl: Risk assessment model
# - goal_success_model.pkl: Goal success prediction model  
# - label_encoders.pkl: Label encoders for risk model
# - goal_success_label_encoders.pkl: Label encoders for goal model

# Note: Models are not included in the repository due to size.
# The system will use rule-based fallbacks when models are not available.
